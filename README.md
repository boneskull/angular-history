angular-history
===============

A history service for AngularJS.  Undo/redo, that sort of thing.  Has nothing to do with the "back" button, unless you want it to.

Current Version
===============
```
0.3.0
```

Installation
============

```
bower install angular-history
```

Requirements
============

- AngularJS 1.1.x (or wherever `$watchCollection()` shows up)
- (optional) [ngLazyBind](https://github.com/Ticore/ngLazyBind)

Running Tests
-------------

Clone this repo and execute:

```
npm install
```

to grab the dependencies.  Then execute:
 
```
grunt test
```

to run the tests.  This will grab the test deps from bower, and run them against QUnit in a local server on 
port 8000.  This grunt task uses a watch, so it'll wait for file updates; just ctrl-c out of it when you see
"Waiting...".

Usage
=====

First, include the `decipher.history` module in your application:

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', ['decipher.history']);
```

Next, you will want to inject the `History` service into your component:

```javascript
angular.module('myApp').controller('MyCtrl', function($scope, History) {
    // ...
});
```

Optionally, you can grab the [ngLazyBind](https://github.com/Ticore/ngLazyBind) module if you want to support lazy binding.  This becomes useful if you have say, an `<input type="text">` field,
and you don't want every keystroke recorded in the history.  If this
module is present, the `History` service will provide extra options.

Watching an Expression
----------------------

You will want to give the `History` service an expression to watch:

```javascript
angular.module('myApp').controller('MyCtrl', function($scope, History) {
    $scope.foo = 'bar';
    History.watch('foo', $scope);
});
```

An optional third parameter is the `description`, which will be emitted when an item is archived, undone, or redid, via a `$broadcast()`.  (TODO: `revert()` support for a `$broadcast()`.)  This allows you to attach to the event and do something with the info, such as pop up an alert with an "undo" button in it.  This value is interpolated against the passed `$scope` object.

If you have the `ngLazyBind` module, you may provide a fourth parameter to `History.watch()`:

```javascript
History.watch('foo', $scope, 'Foo changed to {{foo}}', {timeout: 500});
```

This tells the history stack to update no more often than every 500ms. This value defaults to 1s.  If you wish to use lazy binding with the default, then simply pass an empty object `{}` as the fourth parameter.  If you do not have the `ngLazyBind` module installed, this object will simply be ignored.

Undoing/Redoing
---------------

Once something is `watch()`ed, you can undo or redo changes to it, *if that expression is assignable*.  If you
pass a function as the expression, you may not undo/redo, but you will still have access to the history stack.  
Anyway, to undo, execute:

```javascript
History.undo('foo', $scope);
```

The `$scope` will be updated with the most recent version of the object.  You can `undo()` as many times as 
there are changes in the expression's value since you `watch()`ed it--this is an entire history stack.

Furthermore, an event will be emitted.  The `$rootScope` will `$broadcast()` a `History.undone` event with the following information:

- `expression`: The expression that was undone
- `oldValue`: The value the expression was changed to
- `newValue`: The value the expression was before this (maybe these names should switch?)
- `description`: The optional `description` you may have passed
- `scope`: The scope passed to `undo()`

Redoing is pretty much as you would expect:

```javascript
History.redo('foo', $scope);
```

This only works if you have previously undone something, of course.  You can undo multiple times, then redo multiple times.  The event emitted after redo is `History.redone` and the information is the same.

Use `History.canUndo(exp, scope)` and `History.canRedo(exp, scope)` if you need to know those things.

Revert
------

You can revert to the original value at the time of the `watch()` instruction by issuing:

```javascript
History.revert('foo', $scope);
```

At the time of this writing, it does not emit a `History.reverted` event, but it should.

Forgetting
----------

If you want to stop watching an expression for changes, issue:

```javascript
History.forget('foo', $scope);
```

The history will be purged and the watch will be removed.

Fanciness: Deep Watching
------------------------

Maybe it could use a different name, but often situations arise where you want to watch an entire array of objects for a change in any of those objects' properties.  It would be incredibly inefficient to watch the entire array/object for changes, and you wouldn't necessarily know what property got updated.  This is still a very new feature, but you can do it like so:

```javascript
$scope.foos = [
  {id: 1, name: 'winken'},
  {id: 2, name: 'blinken'},
  {id: 3, name: 'nod'}
];
History.deepWatch('f.name for f in foos', $scope, 
  'Foo with ID {{f.id}} changed to {{f.name}}');
```

This works for objects as well:

```javascript
$scope.foos = {
  '1': {name: 'fe'},
  '2': {name: 'fi'},
  '3': {name: 'fo'},
  '4': {name: 'fum'}
};
History.deepWatch('value.name for (key, value) in foos', $scope, 
  'Foo with ID {{key}} changed its name to {{value.name}}');
```

Now, whenever a name of any one of those things changes, history will be put on the stack.

Unfortunately with this method you simply can't call `History.undo()` like you would a normal watch, because
what are you going to use for the expression?  To handle this, what you want to do is bind to the `History.archived`
event, and do something like this (where `foos` is an array in this example):

```javascript
History.deepWatch('f.name for f in foos', $scope, 
  'Foo with ID {{f.id}} changed to {{f.name}}');

$scope.$on('History.archived', function(evt, data) {
  $scope.undo = function() {
    History.undo(data.expression, data.locals);
  };
});

$scope.foos[0].name = 'fuh';

```

So you can bind to `undo()` in your view, and it will undo the change to `foos[0].name`.

`data`, as passed to the event handler, will look similar to the `History.undone` event as mentioned above:

- `expression`: The expression that got archived, local to `locals`
- `oldValue`: The value the expression was changed to
- `newValue`: The value the expression was before this (maybe these names should switch?)
- `description`: The optional `description` you may have passed
- `locals`: A scope containing your expression's value.  For example, above we will have the object `f` available
in `locals`, with a `name` property.

Otherworldly Fanciness: Batching
--------------------------------

You can group a bunch of changes together and undo them all at once.  You will receive `History.archived` events for each change, but when you undo (in this case, `rollback()`), you will only receive one event with a lot of information about what happened.  For example (taken from the unit tests):

```javascript

// setup some data
scope.$apply('foo = [1,2,3]');
scope.$apply('bar = "baz"');
scope.$apply(function () {
  scope.data = [
    {id: 1, name: 'foo'},
    {id: 2, name: 'bar'},
    {id: 3, name: 'baz'}
  ];
  scope.otherdata = {
    1: {
      name: 'foo'
    },
    2: {
      name: 'bar'
    },
    3: {
      name: 'baz'
    }
  };
});

// watch some of these things through various means
History.watch('foo', scope, 'foo array changed');
History.watch('bar', scope, 'bar string changed');
History.deepWatch('d.name for d in data', scope, 'name in data changed');
History.deepWatch('od.name for (key, od) in otherdata', scope,
  'name in otherdata changed');

// change some things outright
scope.$apply('pigs = "chickens"');
scope.$apply('foo = [4,5,6]');
```

Next we'll initiate a batch.  You will receive a special new scope that you can then pass to `History.rollback()` which will roll back all changes made within the batch closure.  See below.

The function you pass to `History.batch()` will accept a scope parameter, and that is actually a child scope of the real scope.  Changes are made here and propagated to the parent's history.

```javascript
var t = History.batch(function (scope) {
  scope.$apply('foo[0] = 7');
  scope.$apply('foo[1] = 8');
  scope.$apply('foo[2] = 9'); // 3 changes to "foo"
  scope.$apply('data[0].name = "marvin"'); // one change to the "data" array
  scope.$apply('otherdata[1].name = "pookie"'); // one change to the "otherdata" array
  scope.$apply('bar = "spam"'); // change to a string
  scope.$apply('pigs = "cows"'); // change to something *not* watched
}, scope);
```

Notice the second parameter above which is the real scope.  Again, the scope passed into the callback is a child of this scope.

Now let's handle a rollback.  First let's make sure we catch the event so we can report what happened to the user.

```javascript
scope.$on('History.rolledback', function (evt, data) {
  // data looks like:
  /*
  {
    bar: {
      descriptions: ["bar string changed"],
      values: [
        {"oldValue": "spam", "newValue": "baz"}
      ],
      scope: {}, // actual "t" scope
      comparisonScope: {} // original scope
    },
    foo: {
      values: [
        {"oldValue": [7, 8, 9], "newValue": [7, 8, 6]},
        {"oldValue": [7, 8, 6], "newValue": [7, 5, 6]},
        {"oldValue": [7, 5, 6], "newValue": [4, 5, 6]}
      ],
      descriptions: [
        "foo array changed",
        "foo array changed",
        "foo array changed"
      ],
      scope: {}, // actual "t" scope
      comparisonScope: {} // original scope
    },
    "d.name": {
      values: [
        {
          "newValue": "foo",
          "oldValue": "marvin"
        }
      ],
      descriptions: [
        "name in data changed"
      ],
      scope: {}, // actual "t" scope,
      comparisonScope: {} // special local scope used within deepWatches
    },
    "od.name": { //.. same as above, really
    }
  }
  */
});
scope.$apply(function () {
  History.rollback(t);
});
```

For testing purposes we wrap the call to `History.rollback()` in an `$apply()`, but this is likely not necessary outside of unit testing.

Let's see what we ended up with by viewing some assertions:

```javascript
Q.deepEqual(scope.foo, [4, 5, 6], 'foo is again [4,5,6]');
Q.equal(scope.bar, 'baz', 'bar is again baz');
Q.equal(scope.pigs, 'cows', 'pigs is still cows (no change)');
Q.equal(scope.data[0].name, 'foo', 'data[0].name is again "foo"');
Q.equal(scope.otherdata[1].name, 'foo', 'otherdata[1].name is again foo');

// see that you can undo further in some cases
History.undo('foo', scope);
Q.deepEqual(scope.foo, [1, 2, 3], 'foo is again [1,2,3]');

// see you can redo again
History.redo('foo', scope);
Q.deepEqual(scope.foo, [4, 5, 6], 'foo is again [4,5,6]');

// but also that you can't redo past the rollback.
// I suppose this could change, but it would put a lot
// of extra crap in the history.
Q.ok(!History.canRedo('foo', scope), 'assert no more history');
```

This batching hasn't been tested with the "lazy" functionality mentioned earlier (yet), but it will certainly help you support mass changes to many variables at once, and be able to report those changes to the user.

Internals
---------
To debug, you can grab the stack itself by asking the service for it:

```javascript
console.log(History.history);
```

Other properties of the `History` service include `pointers` (which keeps a pointer to the index in the 
`history` we are at), `watches` (which are the actual `$watch` functions on the Scope objects), and 
`descriptions` which stores any `description` parameters passed to `watch()`.
